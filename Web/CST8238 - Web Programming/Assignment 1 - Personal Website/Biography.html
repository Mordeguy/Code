			<h2><u>BIOGRAPHY</u></h2>
			
			<p>My name is Nathan Abbey and I am from Ottawa. This is my second time attending Algonquin College; the first was for the Developmental Services Worker program. I am working part-time as I attend school. I hope to graduate from this program and have a successful career in the IT field.</p>

			<p>I enjoy live music and like to go to open mic nights around Ottawa. I prefer live music to pre-recorded music anyday! I actually played a wedding cocktail hour with a friend of mine this summer; we did an acousitc guitar show. I attend a music festival every August long weekend called Blue Skies and it is an amazingy welcoming festival to attend with great live performances.</p>

			<p> I have a twin brother who lives out in Calgary. He is married with 2 children. We are fraternal twins. I was lucky enough to fly out to Calgary this summer and visit him and his family. He also came to Ottawa at the end of the summer. It was good to see him, his wife and 2 kids. </p>
