			    <li><h1>What are the different parts of a CSS style rule?</h1></li>
			    <h2>The different parts of the CSS style rule are: the selector, the first declaration which consists of the property and value, and the second declaration (if neccesary) which follows the same conditions. The declarations end in a semi-colon and curly brackets surround the declarations.</h2> 
	
			    <li><h1>What is the difference between a relative and absolute measure unit in CSS? Why are relative units preferred over absolute units in CSS?</h1></li>
			    <h2>Relative units of measurement scale better across different platforms because their size is relative to other items on the page. Whereas absolute units of measurements are fixed and will be hard to view in certain setups; they have fixed set of pixels assigned.</h2>


			    <li><h1>What are an element selector and grouped element selector in CSS? Provide an example of each.</h1></li>
			    <h2>Element selectors enables someone in CSS to select all of a certain data type and apply stylized changes to the selected element(p {color: red;}. A grouped element selector enables you to group element selectors togehter with the use of a comma; kind of like an OR operator that operates independently: p, h2, h5 { color: green;}.</h2>
			    <li><h1>What are class selectors in CSS? What are id selectors in CSS?</h1></li>
			
			    <h2>Class selectors (.) enables someone to choose elements that have been defined to belong to the certain class name. This means that someone can specify which certain item(s) out of the same data type that the programmer wants to manipulate; only that data in that class type will be modified, those outside will be un-touched. Id is a lot like class; howeverm it is more for a single element instead of numerous ones grouped into a class.</h2>
			    <li><h1>What are contextual selectors in CSS?</h1></li>
			    <h2>This enables someone to choose elements within another element ot affect. Such as all of the images within a specific section can be manipulated without affecting those outside the section. This can be done by adding the section name followed by a space and then the element type. This makes styling a website easier.
